# Recognition of Face Emotion in Real Time 🧑🏽‍💻

## Technologies Used 💻
- Python 🐍
- NumPy 🔢
- OpenCV 📷
- Keras 🧠
- TensorFlow 🤖

## Project Timeline 📅
June 2023 – July 2023

## Project Description 📝
This project involved designing a real-time facial emotion recognition system using CNNs and OpenCV, achieving accurate results from live webcam feed. We utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow for data preprocessing and model creation. Our CNN-based architecture included Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers for effective feature extraction and classification. We evaluated the model's performance using a confusion matrix and classification report, confirming its accuracy and effectiveness in emotion recognition. 😀😢😠😱
